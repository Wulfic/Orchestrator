## Orchestrator Extension

This VS Code extension provides a Copilot-like sidebar chat UI powered by LM Studio.

### Features
- Chat with LM Studio directly from the sidebar
- Step-by-step orchestration workflow with error handling and retry logic
- Output and error display in both sidebar and output channel

### Usage
1. Start LM Studio locally (default endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:1234)
2. Open the Orchestrator sidebar in VS Code
3. Type your prompt and click Send
4. Review output and errors in the sidebar and output channel

### Next Steps
- Success metrics (linting, test coverage, latency) will be added soon
- Multi-agent and multi-language support planned
